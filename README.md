## Installation
1. Download the latest release from [releases section](https://github.com/Matzeall/PokeMMO-Companion/releases)
2. Extract the application archive to where you typically store your applications (location doesn't matter, aslong the contents of the PokeMMO-Companion folder stay on the same relative path to one another)
3. Open the PokeMMO-Companion executable (PokeMMO-Companion.exe on Windows, PokeMMO-Companion on Linux)

> [!NOTE]
> You must also repeat this process to update to a newer release, since I haven't had the time to make a proper installer.\
> Just be sure to copy over all custom changes you made to the resources folder.
