##### Notes:

- start with exactly the 3 required Pokémon
- in the following **order**: Chandelure, Rotom, Lunatone
- “Kill the legendary beast” = Entei/Raikou - Hidden Power, Suicune - Thunderbolt
- On turn 6 Lunatone can't crit, otherwise Ho-Oh dies and we don't want him to die now.
- At the end of Turn 9, Ho-Oh usually kills one of your Pokémon, but that's not a problem, kill him with the two that remain.
